## **Feature Transformation**

* **Normalize numerical features**: Normalize numerical features such as wheel-base, length, width, height, curb-weight, and price to ensure consistent scaling.
* **Encode categorical features**: Encode categorical features such as make, fuel-type, aspiration, body-style, drive-wheels, engine-location, engine-type, num-of-cylinders, and fuel-system using one-hot encoding or label encoding to convert them into numerical features.

## **Feature Selection**

* **Correlation analysis**: Perform correlation analysis to identify highly correlated features and remove redundant features.
* **Recursive feature elimination**: Use recursive feature elimination to select the most informative features that contribute to the target variable.
* **Permutation importance**: Use permutation importance to evaluate the importance of each feature and select the top-ranked features.

By applying these feature engineering techniques, we can create new features that provide additional insights, transform features into a more suitable format for modeling, and select the most informative features to improve model performance.
